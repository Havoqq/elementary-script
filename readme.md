# elementary-script

This is my personal fork of michaeldaniel's elementary-script. A tiny script that helps you perform necessary tasks after elementary OS installation.

## Run

If for some reason we have similar taste when it comes to the software or you just find it useful, copy and paste the following lines into a terminal window in order to run the script.

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Havoqq/elementary-script/master/elementary-script.sh > /tmp/elementary-script.sh && chmod +x /tmp/elementary-script.sh && /tmp/elementary-script.sh
```

## elementary OS Version Compatibility

elementary-script supports the latest stable version of elementary OS, which at the moment is **elementary OS 0.3.1 Freya**.
